# Classification of Quality of Cars

Project which expands on the second coursework of the Methods for Data Science module I took as part of my MSc Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.

I worked with a data set that contains various variables describing used cars. This data set contains a record of the rating of a series of cars by a car dealer into the following categories: 'unacceptable', 'acceptable', 'good', or 'very good'. The data set also contains the following descriptors for each car: 
- buying:  buying price
- maint: price of the maintenance
- doors: number of doors
- persons: capacity in terms of persons to carry
- lug_boot: the size of luggage boot
- safety: estimated safety of the car

I then compared a variety of classification methods ability to use these descriptors to classify the data points.
